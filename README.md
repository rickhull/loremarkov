Introduction

Need to generate text in a hurry?  This is the tool for you!

With several sample texts built in, you can generate plausible sounding
passages, ready for copy / pasting, at the push of a button.  Just install the
gem and run `destroy` for the default *lorem ipsum* paragraph.

Try `destroy epigenetics` or `destroy oslo_accords` for additional fun.  Or
 provide your own: `destroy ~/my_first_corpus.txt`
