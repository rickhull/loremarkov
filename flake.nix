# HOW TO USE:
# 1. make a `profiles/` directory in your repo and add to .gitignore
# 2. nix develop --profile profiles/dev
# 3. done!
#
# the shell is completely safe from garbage collection and evaluates instantly
# due to Nix's native caching. if you want logs during build, add `-L` to 
# `nix develop`.
